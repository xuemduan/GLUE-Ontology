# Scope of the Ontology and Quick Start

The GLUE ontology provides a flexible schema to represent adhesives, related substrates, materials and applications.

The following figure showcases an overview of the primary entities and relationships of the ontology. All adhesives (glue:Adhesive) belong to an adhesive family (glue:AdhesiveFamily). Adhesive families are characterized by various adhe- sion quality measures (glue:AdhesionQuality) depending on the material types (glue:MaterialFamily) of the substrates (glue:Substrate) that are adhered and by the applications (glue:AdhesionApplication) they are typically used in, across different types of manufacturing industries (glue:Industry).

Quick start: Check out the ontology's [documentation](http://w3id.org/mlso) and Turtle [file](https://github.com/dtai-kg/GLUE-Ontology/blob/main/glue_ontology.ttl).
